**SPEED**

_Speed is an MVC (iMVC/IDM*) PHP web application development framework that empowers a rapid and clean developent process.
iMVC is a regular MVC with an Intrinsic Dynamic Modeling (IDM) feature that also supports file-based models.
The query builder is part of the IDM and adopts a natural language syntax for writing SQL._

**REQUIREMENTS**

-  Apache 2.2 or higher

-  PHP 5.6 or higher
   - _JSON support_
   - _mysqli extension_
   - _SimpleXML extension_
   - _DomDocument support_

   Optional Extensions
   - _Tidy support_
   
-  MariaDB 10 or higher

**FEATURES**

-  _iMVC with IDM (improved MCV with Instrinsic Dynamic Modelling) lets you write models anywhere as and when required, without a
   rigid file-based model definition. IDM also supports file-based models, but is less dynamic and more prone to issues.
   Models are loaded and cached to prevent the IDM from negatively impacting performance whilst delivering the dynamism required._ 

-  _IDM uses a unique strategy that makes all models automatically aware of their parent schema and external relationships._

-  _Simple to use query builder that follows natural language and logic, with automatic foreign data ssociations._

-  _A two-step data validation that ensures sanitized and strictly enforced data types. Data is validated against the schema
   definition, then may also be validated against a custom set of rules for each use case._ 

-  _CSRF protection in one easy step, with custom functions for form handilng and submission._

-  _XML-based layout views and partials make building UIs easy and fast. Binding data to the view takes just a few steps,
   usually between 1 and 3 easy steps. The strategy adopted leaves a clean view and ensures a standard-compliant layout._ 

-  _Speed features Activate, a custom jQuery extension for markup based AJAXing in a few easy steps. Activate also exposes
   PHP data in the DOM for use in JS functionality._

-  _F7 CMS for managing content and access control. F7 itself is quick to deploy and has a simple and easy to use interface.
   The UI of a simple F7-powered CMS could be setup within minutes, using a modular and extensible XML structure._
